# Surprise Party

Don't tell anyone, it's a secret! We are throwing a surprise party
for my best friend. Here's how a surprise party works:
First, ask guests to bring a nice gift and to arrive early
so they don't ruin the surprise. Next, ask the guest of honor
to find you at the back door and time of the party, but don't tell
them why. Then, head for the party with Krista and Pete. When
the guest arrives, everyone shouts "Surprise!".

I think surprise parties are frightening!
